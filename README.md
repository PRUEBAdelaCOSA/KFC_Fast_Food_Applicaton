# KFC_Fast_Food_Application
Welcome to the KFC Fast Food Application! This project is a web-based platform inspired by the KFC website, offering users the convenience of ordering delicious fried chicken and other fast-food items. In this repository, we've developed a responsive and user-friendly website with functionalities such as menu checkout, account creation, cart management, and a secure payment process.
